* Summary of Speeding up Distributed Request-Response Workï¬‚ows by Jalaparti et al.
** Abstract

  Varying delays of interactive services at Bing are a result of request processing by means of parallelization, sequentially through several layers and aggregation of a multitude of sub-queries. To mitigate tail latency, three primary strategies are used:

1) Re-issuing sub-queries
2) Speeding up so called "laggards"
3) Allow a certain amount of incompleteness in the final result.

The results are promising: When 0.1 % of responses are allowed to contain partial results, the 99th percentile is decreased by 50 %. By reissuing only 5 % of requests, 25 % of services receive a 40 % reduction in tail latency.
